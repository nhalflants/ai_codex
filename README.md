# Codex AI Chatbot

Welcome to the Codex AI Chatbot project! This project aims to provide a chatbot interface powered by AI to assist developers in writing and debugging code. It consists of two applications: a front-end application generated using Vite and a back-end Node.js application using Express for the web server and Nodemon for automatic server restarting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/nhalflants/ai_codex
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd ai_codex
3. Install the dependencies for both applications (front-end and back-end):

    ```shell
    npm install
## Front-end Application

The front-end application is generated using Vite, a fast web development build tool. It provides a user interface for interacting with the Codex AI Chatbot.

### Usage
To start the front-end application, run the following command:

    npm run dev

This will start a development server and open the application in your default browser. You can access it at http://localhost:3000.

## Back-end Application

The back-end application is built using Express, a popular Node.js web framework, and utilizes Nodemon for automatic server restarting during development.

### Usage
To start the back-end application, run the following command:

    npm run server

This will start the Express server, and you will see the server running on http://localhost:8080.
